# Module 9: Perceiving Permissions
## Changing File Ownership

**Task:** Change ownership of a file.

**Process:** Use `chown hacker /flag` to change the ownership of the file to the _hacker user_.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ chown hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{E2Dv83ScQoF1keywE5jz9-Y6c3P.dFTM2QDLwkTN0czW}
```


**Flag:** `pwn.college{E2Dv83ScQoF1keywE5jz9-Y6c3P.dFTM2QDLwkTN0czW}`
</br>

## Groups and Files

**Task:** Change group ownership of a file.

**Process:** Use `chgrp` to change the group ownership of the file to your current group.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ chgrp hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{wtsMt16kl-F7PIhtGaEKdTOeoGB.dFzNyUDLwkTN0czW}
```


**Flag:** `pwn.college{wtsMt16kl-F7PIhtGaEKdTOeoGB.dFzNyUDLwkTN0czW}`
</br>

## Fun With Groups Names

**Task:** Identify your group name.

**Process:** Use `id` to list the groups your _user_ is a member of.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ id
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(grp12609) groups=1000(grp12609)
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ chgrp grp12609 /flag
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{0Zck-4qjHW4oiBnHFggTmPAwuZN.dJzNyUDLwkTN0czW}
```


**Flag:** `pwn.college{0Zck-4qjHW4oiBnHFggTmPAwuZN.dJzNyUDLwkTN0czW}`
</br>

## Changing Permissions

**Task:** Change permissions to read a file.

**Process:** Use `chmod a+r /flag` to add read permissions for the owner of the file.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ chmod a+r /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{UOHUAMwB0dwHDApFjTneBlhNMFb.dNzNyUDLwkTN0czW}
```


**Flag:** `pwn.college{UOHUAMwB0dwHDApFjTneBlhNMFb.dNzNyUDLwkTN0czW}`
</br>

## Executable Files

**Task:** Make a file executable.

**Process:** Use `chmod u+x /challenge/run` to add execute permissions for others.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod u+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Q_DIF5ypbmCf-DL5WPXtUPocTgH.dJTM2QDLwkTN0czW}
```


**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q_DIF5ypbmCf-DL5WPXtUPocTgH.dJTM2QDLwkTN0czW}`
</br>

## Permission Tweaking Practice

**Task:**

## The SUID Bit

**Task:** Set _SUID_ on a program.

**Process:** Use `chmod u+s /challenge/getroot` to set the _SUID bit_ on the program to allow it to run with root privileges.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ /challenge/getroot
SUCCESS! You have set the suid bit on this program, and it is running as root!
